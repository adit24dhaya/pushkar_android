Hey professor, I have tried to fix all the red tagged problems in my code, I might have left a few negligible errors as they were not breaking the code. I wanted to improve the UI by adding some title screen but was not able to figure it out. I wish to make a way better smooth UI in the next assignment.

I have learnt a lot in this assignment and I'm willing to do better in next one, Thank you.
